# Cybersecurity Social Media Analytics

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of cybersecurity discussions on social media using machine learning and data analytics. The project analyzes 7,066 Reddit posts to understand patterns in cybersecurity discussions through sentiment analysis, topic modeling, temporal analysis, and predictive modeling. The main script `cyber_security_analytics_final.py` implements eight different machine learning models to predict post engagement and includes visualization tools for analyzing trends. To use this project, simply clone the repository, install the required packages (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy, joblib, numpy), and run the main script. Results will be saved in the models/ directory and visualizations in the plots/ directory.
